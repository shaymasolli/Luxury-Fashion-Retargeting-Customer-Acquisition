### 1. The Challenge

The brand attracted strong website engagement on its lookbook and bespoke service pages â€” but few visitors converted into consultation requests. Past clients showed high lifetime value but low reactivation. Previous outreach was generic and didnâ€™t match the brandâ€™s tailored, concierge-level experience, resulting in lost revenue opportunities.
